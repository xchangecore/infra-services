XchangeCore Contributor Agreement

I ("I" or "Me"), agree that:

1. I hereby assign to the National Institute for Hometown Security, a Kentucky corporation with an address of 368 N. Highway 27, Suite 1, Somerset, KY 42503 (“NIHS”) with full title guarantee all copyright now or in the future subsisting in any part of the world in any Assigned Contributions to the Software. To the extent that this assignment is for any reason ineffective, and subject to NIHS’s rights in Section 5 below, I grant to NIHS a world-wide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and perpetual, assignable and sublicensable license to copy, distribute, transmit, display, and otherwise use, in each case in an original or modified form, the Assigned Contributions as it wishes.

2.  NIHS grants to Me a world-wide, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and perpetual right to use, copy, modify, transmit and make available to the public (including without limitation via the Internet) and distribute, in each case in an original or modified form, the Assigned Contributions as I wish.

3. The term "Software" refers to “XchangeCore Software,” (“XchangeCore”) available at [https://github.com/xchangecore/xchangecore.github.io], as amended from time to time (including, without limitation, all source code, object code, and screen displays in the user interface) and related documentation including the copyright which, as between NIHS and Me, I acknowledge is owned by NIHS.

4. The term "Assigned Contributions" means any modifications or enhancements to the Software submitted to NIHS or its designee by Me. 

5. I will execute any documents and perform any acts that NIHS requests from time to time to enable NIHS to protect, perfect, enforce or enjoy the rights assigned and/or granted to it under this agreement, at NIHS’s expense.

6.  NIHS will ordinarily make the Assigned Contributions available to the public under a source code license agreement. NIHS may also, in its discretion, make the Assigned Contributions available under other license terms.

7. I will not assert or enforce any patent against (a) NIHS (b) anyone who received the Software and/or the Assigned Contributions from NIHS or (c) anyone who received the Software and/or the Assigned Contributions under a copyleft software license, where that patent is allegedly infringed by any of them using or distributing the Software and/or the Assigned Contributions. I will promptly notify NIHS and provide details of any such patents (and any published patent applications which if granted are likely to constitute such a patent) for which I am the proprietor (or applicant). NIHS will not assert or enforce against Me any patent that is infringed by Me exercising My copyright rights in the Software and/or the Assigned Contributions.

8. If I am or become aware of any patent or other intellectual property right which is, or is likely to be, infringed by the use of the Assigned Contributions, I will promptly notify NIHS.

9. I have not created or assigned to NIHS the Assigned Contributions in breach of My employment or any other contract.

10. To the best of My knowledge I have the legal right to enter into this assignment and have not infringed any third party's intellectual property rights in creating and assigning the Assigned Contributions to NIHS.

11. I make no warranty of the Assigned Contribution's quality, merchantability, satisfactoriness or fitness for a particular purpose.

12. This assignment is governed by U.S. Copyright law and the law of the state of Kentucky.
